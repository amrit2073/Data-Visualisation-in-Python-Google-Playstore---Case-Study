It consists of Data Visualization Case Study of Google Playstore .

Problem Statement

The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. You can ask questions like:

Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
